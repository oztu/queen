Selenium Grid Example

Selenium is a web browser driver. Queen can connect to a Selenium Grid in order to automatically
populate itself with browsers. To do that we'll start a Selenium Grid hub and node on this machine,
then run queen with the configuration defined in queenConfig.js.

Once Queen starts, it will connect to the Selenium hub and request that it spawns a Firefox browser
and points it at it's capture url. Once the browser is connected, Queen will automatically run the
server-side script defined at http://queenjs.com/server-example.js. 

When Firefox  launches and starts guessing numbers, try closing the browser -- Queen will notice 
that it disconnected and launch another instance to continue testing.

The configuration options of this example are defined in queenConfig.js.

To run this example:
1) Download http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar in to this directory
2) Start the Selenium Hub: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar -role hub -hubConfig hub.json
3) Start the Selenium Node: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar -role node -nodeConfig node.json
4) Start Queen: node ../../bin/queen
